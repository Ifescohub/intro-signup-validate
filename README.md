## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [jQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js/) - jQuery
- [jQuery Validation Plugin](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-validation@1.19.5/dist/jquery.validate.js/) - jQuery Plugin
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap/) - For Fonts

### What I learned

This challenge has given me the opportunity to learn a great deal about jQuery and its form validation plugin. WIth this, form validation become more easier and with less code.

### Continued development

I want to further work on my semantic use of HTML tags. Customizing the jQuery form validation to my best taste is what i will look forward to working on.
